			<h2>Ajwain Seeds - Developmentbranch2</h2>
			<p>Ajwain, ajowan(/ˈædʒəwɒn/), or Trachyspermum ammi—also known as ajowan caraway, bishop's weed, or carom—is an annual herb in the family Apiaceae (or Umbelliferae).
			Both the leaves and the seed-like fruit (often mistakenly called seeds) of the plant are consumed by humans.
			The name "bishop's weed" also is a common name for other plants. The "seed" (i.e., the fruit) is often confused with lovage "seed".</p>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>Ajwain's small, oval-shaped, seed-like fruits are pale brown schizocarps, which resemble the seeds of other plants in the family Apiaceae such as caraway, cumin and fennel.
			They have a bitter and pungent taste, with a flavor similar to anise and oregano.
			They smell almost exactly like thyme because they also contain thymol, but they are more aromatic and less subtle in taste, as well as being somewhat bitter and pungent.
			Even a small number of fruits tends to dominate the flavor of a dish.</p>
			<h3>Culinary Uses</h3>
			<p>The fruits are rarely eaten raw; they are commonly dry-roasted or fried in ghee (clarified butter).
			This allows the spice to develop a more subtle and complex aroma.
			It is widely used in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, often as part of a chaunk (also called a tarka), a mixture of spices - sometimes with a little chopped garlic or onion - fried in oil or clarified butter, which is used to flavor a dish at the end of cooking.
			It is also an important ingredient for herbal medicine practiced there. In Afghanistan, the fruits are sprinkled over bread and biscuits.</p>

						<h4 class="card-title">Ajwain and Ayurveda</h4>
						<p class="card-text">Ajwain contains thymol, an essential oil that gives the spice its distinct taste and aroma.
						Another spice that contains thymol is thyme, and this is probably why both ajwain and thyme have similar aromas.
						Most of ajwain's health benefits can be attributed to the presence of thymol<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
						In Ayurveda too, ajwain is a spice recommended for its many beneficial properties.
						In fact, according to The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies by Vasant Lad, people with a Vata disposition are recommended to eat ajwain, both as a spice as well as herbal tea. 
						People with Kapha disposition can include ajwain in their diets, whereas Pita people should avoid ajwain both as a spice as well as in tea.
						Owning to its therapeutic properties, ajwain also makes its way inside 'potlis' or poltices for Ayurvedic massages too.</span></p>
